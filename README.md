A simple mod that adds more potions to the Alchemist shop inventory and you can configure any potion that you want :)

## How to Add More Potions
So, I could not find a list of the item IDs of all the potions, but the vanilla IDs follow a simple rule: `the item name, all lowercase with no space or special characters`, so [Building Potion](https://necessewiki.com/Building_Potion) is just `buildingpotion`. If any of these don't work, check your spelling or you can ask on the Necesse Discord for the item ID maybe
